z3c.recipe.paster:paster
========================

This Zope 3 recipes offers a Paste Deploy script setup for Zope3 projects.

The paster part allows us to setup a plain paster executable which could be
used for start up your zope server using the paste deploy ".ini file like:
``bin/paster serve app.ini``. This recipe inherits the zc.recipe.egg class
and will setup the paster within your egg dependency. All you have to do is
to define your eggs. The benefit of this recipe compared with the built in
PasteScript it the option to choose another name if you need more then one
paster script. This is required if you have paster with different egg
dependencies in one buildout configuration.


Options
-------

The 'serve' recipe accepts the following options:

eggs
  The names of one or more eggs, with their dependencies that should
  be included in the Python path of the generated scripts.

ini
  The paste deploy ``*.ini`` file content.

zope.conf
  The zope.conf file defining the DB used in the WSGI app and the error log
  section.

site.zcml
  The zope site.zcml file used by the zope application.


Test
----

Lets define a (bogus) eggs that we can use in our application:

  >>> mkdir('sample')
  >>> write('sample', 'setup.py',
  ... '''
  ... from setuptools import setup
  ... setup(name = 'sample')
  ... ''')

Now check if the setup was correct:

  >>> ls('bin')
  -  buildout-script.py
  -  buildout.exe

We'll create a ``buildout.cfg`` file that defines our paster configuration:

  >>> write('buildout.cfg',
  ... '''
  ... [buildout]
  ... develop = sample
  ... parts = mypaster
  ...
  ... [mypaster]
  ... recipe = z3c.recipe.paster:paster
  ... eggs = sample
  ...
  ... ''' % globals())

  >>> ls('bin')
  -  buildout-script.py
  -  buildout.exe

Now, Let's run the buildout and see what we get:

  >>> print system(join('bin', 'buildout')),
  Develop: '/sample-buildout/sample'
  Installing mypaster.
  Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/mypaster'.

Now check if the setup was correct:

  >>> ls('bin')
  -  buildout-script.py
  -  buildout.exe
  -  mypaster-script.py
  -  mypaster.exe

Check the content of our new generated paster script. As you can see, the
generated script uses the ``paste.script.command.run`` for starting our server.
This script is generic but uses the path of our eggs and uses the given name:

  >>> cat('bin', 'mypaster')
  <BLANKLINE>
  import sys
  sys.path[0:0] = [
    '/sample-buildout/sample',
    '/sample-pyN.N.egg',
    ...
    '/sample-pyN.N.egg',
    ]
  <BLANKLINE>
  import paste.script.command
  <BLANKLINE>
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      sys.exit(paste.script.command.run())
